#To run many of the packages used in this class you need a linux or unix comand line.
#Doing this on a PC requires the use of Windows subsystem for linux or WSL2.
#You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 to use the commands below. 
#below are the steps to set up a linux comand line on a PC.
#First search powershell in your search bar right click and run as administrator
#in the power shell run the comand
wsl --install
#this should setup all required configurations for wsl
#next we will set the version of WSL to WSL2
wsl --set-default-version 2
#after this you can go to the windows store and search Ubuntu to install an app that allows you to open your linux distribution.
#On running your ubuntu install for the first time you will set a username and password I suggest saving them for future use.

#To access your ubuntu file structure from file explorer you need to search for it. 
#To do this open file explorer and enter \\wsl$ into the address bar.
#once you do this you should see a Ubuntu folder once you open it you should see your Ubuntu files structure.
#navigate to your home directory and pin it to your favorits in file explorer to easy access later.
