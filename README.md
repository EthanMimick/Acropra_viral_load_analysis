This is the code that I used to anaylze Iliana Baums Acropora species data set looking at viral load. While in Dr. Lydia Jeanne Bakers Molecular methods and Bioinformatics class. To follow this procedure use the table of contents below. All of this code is set up for the use of windows subsystem for linux.
Table of Contents:
1. setting_up_WSL2
2. Setting_up_anaconda3
3. file_retrieval_SRA
4. metaSPAdes_assembly
5. Binning_of_contigs
6. Kaiju_viral_id
7. R_viral_analysis
Some steps are example of how to use it but may not be fesible to run some of these procedure on your computer specifically metaSPAdes_assembly

Acknoledgment:
I would like to thank Dr. Lydia Baker for her help in and contributions of R code and anotations to this project.
