#For ease of using different software inside your linux environment we will install anaconda3
#inside your linux comand line run
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
#close and reopen your linux comand line
#before your directory you should see (base)
#you have now successfully installed anaconda3

#if it did not automatically load run the code below
#navigating to your conda bin with all conda comands
cd .anaconda3/bin
#to check if conda is active
./conda
#if you get  
usage: conda [-h] [--no-plugins] [-V] COMMAND ...
#run
./conda init

#adding channels 

#channels are used by anaconda3 to find packages you want to install.
#to add channels you run
conda config --add channels <new_channel>
#for this tutorial we will add two channels
1. conda-forge
2. bioconda

#creating environments

#once these channels are installed we can create environemnts for different tools
#environments let you load different packages in anaconda3
#to create an environemnt run 
conda create -n<name_of_environment> <packages_you_want_in_this_environment>
#listed below are all enivronments used in this project and the packages inside them
env:sra packages:sra-tools
env:SPAdes packages:spades
env:binning packages:maxbin2,metabat2,concoct,drep,samtools
